I really thought the most interesting thing we learned in class today was the history of AI. It is not like any of the other basic 
sciences or math we cover in school, instead it is very new. A lot still has yet to be discovered which I think is really interesting. 
Also to see how people were already thinking about AI when computers were still very new and even when they did not exist was cool too.
